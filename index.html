        My Mother is entering My dream now<br>
        She's wearing a wedding dress<br>
        Something's wrong with the way she walks the aisle<br>
        I think it's her legs<br>
        Suddenly there is someone else beside her<br>
        That man I recognize<br>
        The Doctor intends to marry Mother<br>
        It's got to be stopped<br>
        Now what have I done<br>
        My Mother's on the floor and the Doctor's gone<br>
        Everything is wrong<br>
        And as I keep the axe I wonder what's to come<br>
        I'm caught within a dream there's no way out<br>
        I can't escape<br>
        If only I could see the light of day<br>
        I might escape the dream<br>
        The wedding dream<br>
        Oh the dream<br>
        Now everything turns to darkness<br>
        Deep within I feel like I'm going blind<br>
        There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare<br>
        Someone's calling, guiding me back inside<br>
        The dream<br>
        No<br>
        Get away from him Mother<br>
        You betterâ€¦<br>
